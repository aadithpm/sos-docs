# SoS Website

Website ([https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/](https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/)) for [SoS](https://github.com/vatlab/SoS), and [SoS Notebook](https://github.com/vatlab/sos-notebook). The website is built on a simple bootstrape `index.html` that links to a number of HTML pages converted from Jupyter notebook. All documentations and examples are also generated this way so that we can easily re-run notebooks with the latest version of SoS and keep documentations up to date.
